# About

This is a fork of: https://github.com/NayamAmarshe/firefox-multi-touch-zoom

I added a simple way to support mouse movement when zoomed-in by pressing SHIFT key and moving the mouse.

I do not plan to actively support this extension.

# Installation

- clone this repo or [download and the code](https://github.com/bmarwane/chrome-multi-touch-zoom/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)

- Open the extensions page
- Turn on Developer Mode
- Press 'Load Unpacked' button.
- choose the 'extension' folder
- use Shift & 2 finger swipe up or down to use smooth-zooming.

the extension will now be active whenever you load a page, so refresh any tab that was open prior to the installation of this extension.

# How to use

**Zoom in / out**

Use Shift + 2-finger-swipe up/down to use smooth-zooming.

**When zoomed in**

Press Shift to enable to move the viewport using the mouse.
