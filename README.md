This is a fork of: https://github.com/NayamAmarshe/firefox-multi-touch-zoom

I added a simple way support mouse movement during zoom by pressing SHIFT key and moving the mouse.

Just like NayamAmarshe i do not plan to actively support this extension, feel free to use the code if you want to.

# How to use

**Zoom in / out**

Use Shift + 2-finger-swipe up/down to use smooth-zooming.

**When zoomed in**

Press Shift to enable to move the viewport using the mouse.
